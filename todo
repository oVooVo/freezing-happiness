Render: 
 - Render in QList<QImage>, show all rendered Images in Picture manager! Images must be saveable.
 - optionally show frame of rendered area
 - options:
    - size
    - zoom (zoom=1 means one unit is one pixel)
    - offset from root
    - optionally choose custom "camera" object, which defines offset and zoom via its global position and scalation
    - Backgroundcolor (default is invisible)
	

Layers:
 - Provide layer tag, render multiple layers.
    If an object has no layer tag:
      If parent has a layer tag, render on this layer. ( go recursively up until layer tag found.)
      If no parent, grandparent, great-grandparent has a layer, render to default layer.

Tags:
 - Align-to tag (let x/y-axis point to specifyed object)
 - Style-tag (fill, draw, colors, patterns, dashed/dotted/solid/invisible/...)

General:
 - Use RGBA
 - Export each layer on its own
 - try to export all layers in psd format
 - tikz export
 - pdf export (http://www.adobe.com/devnet-apps/photoshop/fileformatashtml/PhotoshopFileFormats.htm)
 - Objects should be convertable to editable objects (e.g. instance can be made editable independently from its reference. Thus instance is no more connected to its reference!)


Objects:
 - Mirror
 - Clone
    - align linear
    - align circular
    - align grid
    - align randomly (reproducable randomness!)
    - align on spline
 - Ellipse
 - Rectangle
 - Image
 - Spline: 
	Different interpolations.
	Points should have tangents
 - Text
 - ...
